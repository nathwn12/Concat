# Concat Engine

The video engine behind Concat. Rust, no GC, no hidden control flow.

## Layout

| Crate | What it is | Dependencies |
|---|---|---|
| `concat-core` | Time, arena, frames, timeline model. The vocabulary every other crate speaks. | **none** (std only) |
| `concat-media` | Getting pixels and samples in and out of files. Links FFmpeg (libav*), and is the only crate that knows it exists. | `concat-core`, ffmpeg-the-third |
| `concat-project` | The edit itself: document model, operations as commands, undo, concat.json IO. | serde, serde_json |
| `concat-render` | Turning a timeline plus a timestamp into one finished frame. | `concat-core`, wgpu (optional) |
| `concat-effects` | Effect packages: manifests, chain templates, the catalogue. Each built-in effect is a folder under `packages/`. | `concat-project`, serde, toml |
| `concat-export` | Timeline to file: flatten, the frame-by-frame render loop, the paused monitor's true frame. | `concat-core`, `concat-media`, `concat-render`, `concat-project`, `concat-effects` |
| `concat-api` | The Concat API: JSON requests in, responses and events out. Projects, edits, media, the catalogue, templates, exports as jobs, frames. | `concat-host`, `concat-export`, `concat-effects`, `concat-project` |
| `concat-server` | The API on a socket: JSON-RPC lines over TCP or a Unix socket, and gRPC behind the `grpc` feature. One dispatcher, many callers. | `concat-api`; tonic and tokio with `grpc` |
| `concat-cli` | A binary to drive the above: `probe`, `render`, `api` (the API over stdin and stdout) and `serve` (the API on a socket). | `concat-server`, `concat-api`, the engine crates |
| `concat-host` | What the window needs that is not the edit: sessions, project folders, previews, playback, templates, job slots. | `concat-media`, `concat-project`, `concat-export`, cpal |
| `concat-speech` | Transcription (whisper.cpp, in-process) and text to speech (Kokoro via sherpa-onnx). | `concat-host`, `concat-media`, whisper-rs, sherpa-onnx |
| `concat` | The editor window: every pane, dialog and primitive, in Slint. The app a user launches. | slint, `concat-host`, `concat-speech` |
| `concat-android` | The Android activity: the entry point that hosts the window on a phone. | `concat`, slint |

The dependency arrows point one way:

```
concat -> concat-speech -> concat-host -> {export, project, media} -> core
                                       -> render -> core
                                          export -> effects -> project
concat-cli -> concat-server -> concat-api -> concat-host
```

If you ever find yourself wanting `core` to depend on `media`, something has
been put in the wrong crate.

`concat` is the app. It opens project folders through `concat-host`, reads
the engine's project to draw the bin and the lanes, and writes every edit as
a `concat-project` command.

## Build and run

```sh
cargo build
cargo test
cargo run -p concat-cli -- probe some-video.mp4
cargo run -p concat-cli -- render some-video.mp4 out.mp4 --frames 120
cargo run -p concat-cli -- api '{"method":"catalogue.list","kind":"filter"}'
cargo run -p concat-cli -- api < edits.jsonl   # one JSON-RPC call per line; see below
cargo run -p concat-cli -- serve               # the same API on 127.0.0.1:7420
cargo run -p concat-cli --features grpc -- serve --grpc 127.0.0.1:7421
cargo run -p concat                    # the editor window, debug
cargo run --profile quick -p concat    # optimised, rebuilds in seconds: for trying changes
cargo build --profile app -p concat    # the shipping binary: fat LTO, panic=abort, stripped
```

Nothing is spawned at run time: FFmpeg is linked, whisper.cpp and sherpa-onnx
are compiled in. A build needs the FFmpeg 7+ development libraries (headers
and import libraries) - `brew install ffmpeg` on macOS, a BtbN `shared` build
unpacked and pointed at with `FFMPEG_DIR` on Windows and on Linux
distributions whose packaged FFmpeg is older than 7 - plus cmake and a C++
toolchain for whisper.cpp. The window builds with Slint's
Skia renderer by default; `--no-default-features --features wgpu` swaps in
FemtoVG over wgpu, and the two are meant to be compared, not chosen once.
On Linux, Skia needs the fontconfig and freetype headers at build time (see
`.github/workflows/build-app.yml` for the package list).

On Nix, the flake at the repository root builds the window with every native
dependency pinned: `nix build` (then `./result/bin/concat`), `nix run`, or
`nix develop` for a shell with the toolchain and libraries in it. Linux
x86_64 and aarch64.

The crates that carry no native library - `concat-core`, `concat-project`,
`concat-effects`, `concat-render` (the wgpu compositor included, on WebGPU)
and `concat-text` - also build for the web, and CI keeps them building:

```sh
cargo check -p concat-core -p concat-project -p concat-effects -p concat-render -p concat-text \
    --features concat-render/gpu --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

The rest is native by nature: `concat-media` links FFmpeg, `concat-host`
talks to the audio device and the file system, `concat-speech` compiles in
whisper.cpp and sherpa-onnx, and `concat` is a window. `concat-export` goes
with them for now because its render loop reads through `concat-media`.

### Phones

The whole engine and the window build for Android (arm64) and iOS
(arm64). Two native libraries come from source for a phone, because no
prebuilt covers them: FFmpeg, which `scripts/ffmpeg-mobile.sh` cross-builds
as static archives with the platform's hardware codecs turned on -
MediaCodec on Android, VideoToolbox on iOS - and whisper.cpp, which its
crate builds with cmake for the target. sherpa-onnx ships as the shared
library k2-fsa publishes, fetched by `scripts/sherpa-mobile.sh`; on Android
the app carries it in `jniLibs`, on iOS as an embedded framework. Both
scripts leave their output under `vendor/`, outside `target/`, and
`scripts/mobile-env.sh` turns that into the build environment:

```sh
# Android: the NDK under the SDK, a JDK, and cargo-ndk or cargo-apk.
scripts/ffmpeg-mobile.sh aarch64-linux-android
scripts/sherpa-mobile.sh aarch64-linux-android
eval "$(scripts/mobile-env.sh aarch64-linux-android)"
cargo ndk -t arm64-v8a --platform 26 build -p concat-android   # the activity's .so
cargo apk build --release -p concat-android                     # the APK, signed with
                                                                # CARGO_APK_RELEASE_KEYSTORE

# iOS: Xcode.
scripts/ffmpeg-mobile.sh aarch64-apple-ios
scripts/sherpa-mobile.sh aarch64-apple-ios
eval "$(scripts/mobile-env.sh aarch64-apple-ios)"
cargo build --release -p concat --target aarch64-apple-ios
scripts/ios-app.sh aarch64-apple-ios release                    # Concat.app
```

`.github/workflows/mobile.yml` runs exactly this on every pull request
and on a release tag, and keeps the FFmpeg builds cached. The window is one library: `concat` on the
desktop and on iOS runs it from `main.rs`, `concat-android` from the
activity's `android_main`, and `crates/concat/src/platform.rs` is where
the three differ - how the backend is chosen, how files are picked, and
whether there is a title strip to drag.

## Measuring

`cargo run -p concat-perf --release` prints a table of how fast the parts
a person waits on are - planning a frame, an undo, opening a document,
decoding, a scrub through the cache, compositing on the CPU and the GPU,
an export - each against a budget, on synthetic media so the numbers are
the machine's and the code's. `--check` fails the run when a scenario is
outside its budget; `--quick` skips the media, and CI runs the quick set
that way on every push.
The quick scenarios also run under `cargo test`, so a regression there
stops the build. See `crates/concat-perf/src/main.rs` for what each
number means and what is not measured.

## Driving Concat without the window

The full reference - every method, every edit command, every type, and a
page per transport - is in [`docs/`](../docs/README.md) at the repository
root. What follows is the short version.

Everything the window does to a project, a script can do through the Concat
API: `concat-api` is the one dispatcher, and the transports only carry it.
On a line - stdin, TCP, a Unix socket - a call is JSON-RPC 2.0, one object
per line, and the response comes back with the call's id:

```jsonl
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"project.open","params":{"path":"/edits/Reel"}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":{"project":{...},"canUndo":false,...}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"edit.apply","params":{"path":"/edits/Reel","command":{"op":"addTextClip","start":1.5}}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"result":{...}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"export.run","params":{"path":"/edits/Reel","output":"/edits/reel.mp4"}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"result":{"job":"j1","path":"/edits/Reel","output":"/edits/reel.mp4"}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"export.progress","params":{"job":"j1","path":"/edits/Reel","frame":30,"total":900,"stage":"video"}}
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"export.done","params":{"job":"j1","path":"/edits/Reel","output":"/edits/reel.mp4","width":1920,"height":1080}}
```

An `edit.apply` carries a `concat-project` command as it is, so every edit
the window can make is one a caller can make, with the same refusals. An
error is `{"code": -32001, "message": "...", "data": {"code": "notOpen"}}`:
the number is JSON-RPC's, the name in `data` is the API's - `parse`,
`invalid`, `notOpen`, `notFound`, `refused`, `busy`, `cancelled`, `failed`,
`unauthorized`. Exports are jobs: the response names one at once and its
events follow, to every connected caller, each naming its job and project.

`concat-cli serve` puts the same lines on a socket. It binds loopback unless
told otherwise, and every connection, loopback included, presents a token
as its first line, `{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"auth","params":{"token":"..."}}`:
the one given with `--token` (or `CONCAT_API_TOKEN`), or else one minted
at start and printed under the addresses, so only whoever started the
server can hand it out. There is no encryption; a bind off loopback belongs
behind something that has it. With the `grpc` feature the same API is
served over HTTP/2 from `crates/concat-server/proto/concat.proto`, a thin
envelope carrying the same JSON, with the token as `authorization: Bearer
...` metadata. `version` is the call to make first: its reply's
`capabilities` names what the build serves (`events`, `json-rpc`,
`unix-socket`, `grpc`, `gpu`) before anything is asked of it.

## Reading this codebase cold

1. The layout table and dependency arrows above - the map of the whole system.
2. `crates/*/src/lib.rs` - every crate opens with a `//!` block saying what it is for.
3. `cargo doc --open` - the generated API map of the whole engine.

## Conventions

- **Time is exact.** All timestamps are `concat_core::time::Rational` seconds, never `f64`.
  Frame-accurate editing and floating point do not mix.
- **Graphs use handles, not pointers.** `concat_core::arena` explains why.
- **Shallow generics.** Concrete types until three call sites demand otherwise.
- **Threads, not async.** The render path is CPU-bound; `async` buys nothing here.
