//! The Concat API: the one dispatcher every way of driving the editor
//! without its window goes through.
//!
//! The command line, a daemon on a socket, an MCP server, a plugin: each is
//! a transport, and a transport is a loop that reads a [`Request`], hands
//! it to [`Api::dispatch`], and writes the [`Response`] back, forwarding
//! the [`Event`]s the API's jobs raise as they come. Nothing about what a
//! request *means* lives in a transport, so two of them cannot disagree,
//! and a method added here reaches all of them. What a line transport puts
//! around the three is the JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope in [`rpc`].
//!
//! The crate decides nothing about the edit either. Edits are
//! `concat_project` [`Command`]s carried as they are; projects, media,
//! templates, titles, cutouts and exports are `concat_host`'s. What this
//! crate owns is the choreography the window performs by hand - probe then
//! add, find masks and paint titles before rendering, save through the
//! session - stated once so a file exported here is the file the window
//! would have written.
//!
//! One [`Api`] holds one session per open project folder. It is not
//! thread-safe by design: a transport that serves several callers owns the
//! one `Api` and serialises through it, the way the window's event loop
//! does. A method that would keep everyone waiting - an export - runs as a
//! job on its own thread instead: [`Api::dispatch`] returns its name at
//! once and the job reports through the [`EventSink`] the API was made
//! with, from that thread, which is why the sink must be `Send + Sync`.
